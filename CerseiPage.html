			<h1>Cersei Lannister</h1>

			<br>

			<p>Cersei is the only daughter and the eldest of Lord Tywin Lannister's children. She is also an extremely important character in the show Game of Thrones. As the begins she is married to King Robert Baratheon, who dies early on in the show from a hunting accident.</p>

			<br>

			<p>As the show progresses we see Cersei has an evil side, and she is very cunning. She frequently manipulates her son Joffrey (who is also very evil). Additionally, it is revealed in the show that her three children (including Joffrey) are all products of incest with her brother Jaime Lannister. Later on in the series as Cersei gains more control and power and later becomes the sole Queen of the Realm once her son Joffrey dies. A very important scene occurs in the later seasons of the show when her other son Tommen is king.</p>

			<br>

			<p>Moving forward, she gives a religious group power to undermine her daughter in law (who is the current queen at the time). This religious group has so much power that they are able to single-handedly take the Queen into custody and imprison her. Later Cersei's plan back-fires and the religious council also condemns her on multiple charges. On the day of her trial, which she knows the Queen Margaery will be at, she does not show up to the Great Sept where it is held. Shortly after this there is a massive explosion at the Great Sept and Queen Margaery, Mace, Loras Tyrell and all the sparrows (the religious group) are killed (the explosion was planned by Cersei). After learning of his beloved wife's death, Tommen (Cersei's son and the King) jumps from a window commiting suicide as he knows his mother is behind this tragedy.</p>

			<br>

			<p>As the series gets closer to a conclusion, it becomes clear that Cersei is completely evil. Jon Snow approaches her in the last season with a plead to ally with him and Daenarys in order to defeat the white walkers. She agrees, but then never shows up with her army, betraying him. Her plan was to use that as a tactic to weaken Jon and Daenarys' army for when the inevitably come to attack King's Landing. As mentioned in Daenarys page, after Jon and Dany defeat the white walkers they go for King's Landing. Cersei stands her ground and fights back until the last minute. As Daenerys goes mad and is decimating Cersei's city, Cersei runs to the underground chambers of the Red Keep. She meets her lover and brother there and they die together from the ceiling crumbling in on them.</p>
