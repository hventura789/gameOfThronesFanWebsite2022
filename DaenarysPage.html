			<h1>Daenarys Targaryen</h1>

			<br>

			<p>Daenarys Targaryen becomes another extremely important and influential character as the show progresses. As the show begins she is somewhat timid, but then she is wed to Khal Drogo in the first season. The power and courage of Drogo is contagious and she becomes more and more outspoken and brave as the first season progresses. Khal dies later in the first season, and the baby she was to have with him is a miscarraige as well which nearly breaks her. At the end of the first season she takes her petrified dragon eggs and walks into a fire, then walks out unscathed and with 3 living, breathing, baby dragons. Prior to this event, dragons were thought to be extinct.</p>

			<br>

			<p>As the show progresses, Daenarys, the mother of dragons, becomes more and more powerful and also power-hungry. She eventually takes over an army of unsullied by having one of her dragons burn their leader to death. Later in the show she also gains back the army of Dothraki by proving her strength to them. As she gains more and more power, other members of the realm become more fearful of her. It becomes clear that her ultimate goal is to be the queen of the realm. And to take her place on the iron throne in King's Landing.</p>

			<br>

			<p>Eventually, Jon Snow goes to meet Daenarys and they become lovers as well as allies. They team up to defeat the white walkers and to defeat the evil reign of Cersei. As mentioned in Jon Snow's biography they do eventually gain success in defeating the Night King and his army of white walkers and shortly after that they are ready to take on the Lannister army and hopefully defeat Cersei once and for all and gain the Iron Throne.</p>

			<br>

			<p>In the final episode of the series, Daenarys and her dragon (she only has one left at this point), as well as her army of unsullied and Dothraki storm King's Landing and are able to defeat Cersei's army. Cersei surrenders, however Daenarys goes mad with rage and decimates the entire city of King's Landing, killing thousands of innocents in the process. Later, Jon Snow assassinates Daenarys for these actions and the show concludes shortly after.</p>
