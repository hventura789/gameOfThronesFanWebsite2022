			<h1>Bran Stark</h1>

			<br>

			<p>Bran Stark is the son of Lord Ned Stark and Lady Catelyn Stark. He is paralyzed from a fall early on in the show. The fall was actually an attempt to murder Bran by Jaime Lannister. Bran witnessed Jaime and his sister engaging in intercourse and Jaime tried to kill him to keep this a secret. However Bran survived and was paralyzed from the waist down.</p>

			<br>

			<p>As the show moves forward, it is revealed that Bran has powers and that he is a 'Warg' which is someone who can control the minds of animals and some people telepathically. Additionally Bran is able to see the past and future in his dreams. He also has a recurring dream of a three eyed raven throughout the beginning of the show and eventually he goes on a quest to find the three eyed raven and to learn the significance of these dreams.</p>

			<br>

			<p>Later in the show, Bran learns that he must go north beyond the wall in order to find the three eyed raven. After a long quest, he is able to find the three eyed raven, which is an old man who possesses the same powers as Bran. The current three eyed raven must step down and he declares Bran to be the new three eyed raven.</p>

			<br>

			<p>Moving forward, Bran is used as a sort of bait in the great war episode to bait the Night King to come to winterfell so that Jon Snow and Daenarys can assassinate him. The Night King wants to kill Bran because his powers make him a threat to the Night King and his army. Their plan works and they are able to lure the Night King to Bran in order for Arya to assassinate him. In a twist, in the final episode of the show, Bran is named the the new king of the realm after Daenarys is killed. This was a very controversial topic among the GoT fandom.</p>
