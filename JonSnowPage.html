			<h1>Jon Snow</h1>

			<br>

			<p>Jon Snow is arguably the most influential character in the entire series Game of Thrones. Not only is he present throughout all 8 seasons, but he also play a major role in moving the story forward in nearly all seasons, especially in the last 3-4 seasons. In the beginning of the series it is believed that Jon Snow is the bastard son of Ned Stark, however later in the show it is revealed that he is actually Aegon Targaryen, the true heir to the iron throne, and that he was merely adopted by Ned Stark in order to protect the lineage of the House Targaryen, as many wanted to destroy their family.</p>

			<br>

			<p>Early in the show, Jon Snow joins the Night's watch and later becomes the Lord Commander. He eventually makes some controversial decisions and is killed in a mutiny. However, he is later brought back to life by Melisandre.</p>

			<br>

			<p>As the show progresses, Jon becomes essentially the protagonist of the show, forming an alliance with Daenerys Targaryen against the White Walkers in the nearing "Great War." He also falls in love with Daenerys whom he later finds out is his aunt (Due to him actually being a Targaryen as mentioned above). He eventually defeats the Night King, mostly thanks to Arya.</p>

			<br>

			<p>As the show nears conclusion, Daenerys goes mad and lays waste to the city King's Landing even after they surrender to her army, destroying the city completely with her dragon. Jon then makes the decision to assasinate her after this, so that she does not cause any more harm to innocent people. Because of this, Jon is sent into exile in the Night's Watch as the show concludes.</p>
