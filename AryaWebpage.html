			<h1>Arya Stark</h1>

			<br>

			<p>Arya Stark is one of the most important characters in the entire series "Game of Thrones." She is the child of Lord Ned Stark and his wife, Lady Catelyn Stark.</p>

			<br>

			<p>Early in the series, Arya escaped victimization by the House Lannister. She spends a majority of the middle seasons running from the Lannisters and trying to protect her identity, since she is a high born, if people learned that they would surely use it against her and try to hold her ransom.</p>

			<br>

			<p>She eventually is trained as and becomes a faceless man. The faceless men are trained assassins that are able to literally masquerade as other people and can take on their exact appearance in order to assassinate other people.</p>

			<br>

			<p>Towards the end of the show, Arya plays a major role in the great war against the white walkers. She is the unassuming hero of the great war, when she chases after the Night King and successfully kills him, which then in turn kills all of the white walkers. Additionally, in the last season Arya tries to assassinate Cersei, however she is unsuccessful in that pursuit.</p>
