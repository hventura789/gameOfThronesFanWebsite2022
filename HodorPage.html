			<h1>Hodor</h1>

			<br>

			<p>Hodor is also a very important character in Game of Thrones, although unassuming in the beginning of the show. Through his adventures and through revealing more about his background, it becomes clear that he makes a major impact on the progression of the show and explaining the overall story.</p>

			<br>

			<p>In the middle seasons of the show, Hodor goes on Bran's journey to find the three eyed raven, and is instrumental in helping him at times since Bran is physically handicapped. He helps Bran escape certain death at multiple times during his journey and Bran is even able to "warg" into Hodor at cetain points in order to use Hodor's strength to fight off attackers.</p>

			<br>

			<p>In season 6 of GoT Bran and Hodor and Summer reach the cave of the three eyed raven and are being actively pursued and attacked by white walkers. Hodor is pivotal in helping Bran to escape so that he can play his role in "The Great War" agains the white walkers in the final season. Hodor "holds the door" to the cave as the white walkers try to escape and kill Bran, sacrificing himself to protect Bran and ultimately dying in the process. During this time Bran is warging into the past looking at Hodor as a young man. As Hodor is holding the door the young Hodor in the past starts convulsing from the trauma of his future death. This gives him brain damage/PTSD which causes him to only be able to say "Hodor" thus explaining the condition we find him in a the beginning of the series.</p>
